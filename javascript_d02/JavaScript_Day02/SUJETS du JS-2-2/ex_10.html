          When the link in the white box is clicked a cookie "<strong>acceptsCookies</strong>" will be created. It must expire in 1 day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cookie will have the value <strong>true</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the cookie is defined and if its value is true, then the message in the white box must not be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you will need to make a second white box appear with a button "Delete the cookie". When this button is clicked, the second white box and the cookie must be deleted, and the first message must reappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the cookies to work on Chrome, you must use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" when viewing your local page.
