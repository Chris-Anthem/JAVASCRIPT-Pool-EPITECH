You will now implement a search in the elements created. As of now, you only need to handle a search
by types. You will implement a search by words in the following exercise. If I search for “email”, only the
elements being “email” must stay displayed. The others must not be deleted and must be shown again
when the search is over (Once again you’re free for the implementation). */
